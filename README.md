# ESP32 CPAP Data Uploader

Automatically upload CPAP therapy data from your SD card to network storage. Tested with ResMed CPAP machines, may work with other brands that use SD cards.

**Features:**
- Automatic daily uploads to Windows shares, NAS, or Samba servers
- Respects CPAP machine access to SD card
- Tracks uploaded files (no duplicates)
- Scheduled uploads with timezone support
- Web interface for monitoring and testing

## For End Users

See the [User Guide](release/README.md) for complete setup and usage instructions.


## Hardware

**Required:** [SD WIFI PRO](https://www.fysetc.com/products/fysetc-upgrade-sd-wifi-pro-with-card-reader-module-run-wireless-by-esp32-chip-web-server-reader-uploader-3d-printer-parts) adapter
- ESP32-PICO-D4 microcontroller
- 4MB Flash memory
- SD card interface (compatible with CPAP SD cards)
- WiFi 2.4GHz

## Quick Start

### 1. Get the Hardware
Purchase the [SD WIFI PRO](https://www.fysetc.com/products/fysetc-upgrade-sd-wifi-pro-with-card-reader-module-run-wireless-by-esp32-chip-web-server-reader-uploader-3d-printer-parts).

### 2. Download Firmware
Download the latest release package from the [Releases page](../../releases).

### 3. Upload Firmware
Follow the instructions in the release package to upload firmware to your device.

### 4. Configure
Create a `config.json` file on your SD card with your WiFi and network share settings.

### 5. Done!
Insert the SD card and power on. The device will automatically upload new CPAP data daily.

## Configuration Example

Create `config.json` on your SD card:

```json
{
  "WIFI_SSID": "YourNetworkName",
  "WIFI_PASS": "YourPassword",
  "ENDPOINT": "//192.168.1.100/cpap_backups",
  "ENDPOINT_TYPE": "SMB",
  "ENDPOINT_USER": "username",
  "ENDPOINT_PASS": "password",
  "UPLOAD_HOUR": 12,
  "GMT_OFFSET_HOURS": -8
}
```

See the [User Guide](release/README.md) for complete configuration reference.



## How It Works

1. **Device reads configuration** from `config.json` on SD card
2. **Connects to WiFi** and synchronizes time with internet
3. **Waits for scheduled time** (once per day at configured hour)
4. **Uploads new files** to your network share
   - Takes brief control of SD card (default 5 seconds)
   - Uploads DATALOG folders, root files, and settings
   - Tracks what's been uploaded (no duplicates)
   - Releases SD card for CPAP machine use
5. **Repeats daily** automatically

The device respects your CPAP machine's need for SD card access by keeping upload sessions short and releasing control immediately after each session.

## Capacity & Longevity

**Memory:** Currently the firmware with SMB upload and web server enabled can track upload state for **10+ years** of daily CPAP usage (3,000+ folders) before exhausting available RAM.

**Storage:** Based on typical CPAP data size (~2.7 MB per day), the 8GB SD WIFI PRO card can store approximately **8+ years** (3,000+ days) of CPAP data before filling up.

## Project Status

**Current Version:** v0.3.0

**Status:** ✅ Production Ready
- Hardware tested and validated
