## Architecture

### Core Components

- **Config** - Manages configuration from SD card (`config.json`)
- **SDCardManager** - Handles SD card sharing with CPAP machine
- **WiFiManager** - Manages WiFi station mode connection
- **FileUploader** - Orchestrates file upload to remote endpoints

### Upload Management

- **UploadStateManager** - Tracks which files/folders have been uploaded using checksums
- **TimeBudgetManager** - Enforces time limits on SD card access (respects CPAP priority)
- **ScheduleManager** - Manages daily upload scheduling with NTP time synchronization

### Upload Backends

- **SMBUploader** - Uploads files to SMB/CIFS shares (Windows, NAS, Samba)
- **WebDAVUploader** - Uploads to WebDAV servers (TODO: placeholder)
- **SleepHQUploader** - Direct upload to SleepHQ service (TODO: placeholder)

### Supporting Components

- **Logger** - Circular buffer logging system with web API access
- **TestWebServer** - Optional web server for development/testing

### Design Principles

1. **Dependency Injection** - Components receive dependencies via constructor
2. **Single Responsibility** - Each class has one clear purpose
3. **Testability** - Core logic is unit tested
4. **Feature Flags** - Backends are conditionally compiled
5. **Resource Management** - Careful memory and flash usage

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Git
- USB drivers for ESP32 (CH340 or CP210x)

### Quick Setup

Run the automated setup script (caution this has only been tested on linux):

```bash
./setup.sh
```

This will:
1. Create Python virtual environment
2. Install PlatformIO
3. Clone and configure libsmb2 component
4. Install all dependencies

### Manual Setup

If you prefer manual setup:

```bash
# 1. Create Python venv
python3 -m venv venv

# 2. Install PlatformIO
source venv/bin/activate
pip install platformio

# 3. Setup libsmb2 (if using SMB upload)
./scripts/setup_libsmb2.sh

# 4. Install dependencies
pio pkg install
```

### IDE Setup

The project works with:
- **PlatformIO IDE** (VS Code extension) - Recommended
- **Command line** - All features available via CLI

---

## Building

### Quick Build & Upload

```bash
./build_upload.sh
```

### Manual Build

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pio run -e pico32              # Build only
pio run -e pico32 -t upload    # Build and upload
```

### Build Targets

```bash
pio run -e pico32              # Build firmware
pio run -e pico32 -t upload    # Upload to device
pio run -e pico32 -t clean     # Clean build
pio run -e pico32 -t size      # Show memory usage
pio run -e pico32 -t erase     # Erase flash
```

### Build Configuration

Edit `platformio.ini` to configure:

**Feature Flags:**
```ini
build_flags = 
    -DENABLE_SMB_UPLOAD          ; Enable SMB/CIFS upload
    ; -DENABLE_WEBDAV_UPLOAD     ; Enable WebDAV (TODO)
    ; -DENABLE_SLEEPHQ_UPLOAD    ; Enable SleepHQ (TODO)
    -DENABLE_TEST_WEBSERVER      ; Enable test web server
```

**Logging:**
```ini
build_flags =
    -DLOG_BUFFER_SIZE=32768      ; 32KB log buffer
    -DCORE_DEBUG_LEVEL=3         ; Debug level (0-5)
```

### Memory Usage

Current build (with SMB enabled):
- **Flash:** 25.9% (1,058,372 / 4,096,000 bytes) - ESP32 has 4MB flash, app partition is 3MB
- **RAM:** 10.5% (47,165 / 450,000 bytes estimated) - Static: 34KB, Dynamic buffers grow with usage

**Dynamic Memory Analysis:** The `.upload_state.json` file grows with DATALOG folder count (~30 bytes per folder, ~100 bytes per file checksum), and the system now dynamically allocates DynamicJsonDocument buffers sized at 2x the file size for loading and 1.5x estimated size for saving, allowing it to handle thousands of folders limited only by available RAM (~340KB free, supporting ~10+ years of daily CPAP usage before memory exhaustion).

## Testing

### Unit Tests

Run all tests:
```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pio test -e native
```

Run specific test suite:
```bash
pio test -e native -f test_config
pio test -e native -f test_time_budget_manager
pio test -e native -f test_schedule_manager
```

### Test Coverage

- `test_time_budget_manager`: 18 tests - Time budget and rate calculation
- `test_config`: 14 tests - Configuration parsing and validation
- `test_webserver`: 9 tests - Web server endpoints
- `test_native`: 9 tests - Mock infrastructure
- `test_schedule_manager`: 22 tests - Scheduling and NTP

### Hardware Testing

See [Hardware Testing Checklist](#hardware-testing-checklist) below.

## Release Process

### Creating a Release Package

```bash
./scripts/prepare_release.sh
```

This creates a timestamped zip file in `release/` containing:
- `firmware.bin` - Precompiled firmware
- `upload.sh` - macOS/Linux upload script
- `upload.bat` - Windows upload script
- `README.md` - End-user documentation

### Windows Release

For Windows releases, download `esptool.exe` from [espressif/esptool releases](https://github.com/espressif/esptool/releases) and place it in `release/` before running `prepare_release.sh`.

### Version Tagging

Use semantic versioning (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH):

```bash
git tag -a v0.3.0 -m "Release v0.3.0: Description"
git push origin v0.3.0
```

## Architecture Decisions

### Why libsmb2?

- Full SMB2/3 protocol support
- Mature, well-tested library
- Acceptable binary footprint (~220-270KB)
- Active maintenance

### Why Time Budgeting?

CPAP machines need regular SD card access. Time budgeting ensures:
- Short upload sessions, default 5 seconds, configurable.
- CPAP machine gets priority
- Uploads resume automatically

### Why Circular Buffer Logging?

- Fixed memory usage (configurable)
- No SD card writes (reduces wear)
- Thread-safe for dual-core ESP32

### Why Feature Flags?

- Minimize binary size
- Enable only needed backends
- Faster compilation
- Cleaner code separation

---

## Performance Considerations

### Flash Usage

- Base firmware: ~800KB
- SMB backend: +220-270KB
- WebDAV backend: +50-80KB (estimated)
- Total available: 3MB (huge_app partition)

### RAM Usage

- Static allocation: ~47KB
- Log buffer: 32KB (configurable)
- SMB buffers: ~32KB during upload
- Total available: 320KB

### Upload Performance

- Default rate: 40 KB/s (conservative estimate)
- Actual rate: Varies by network and share, during tests the transfer achieved 130KB/s
- Rate tracking: Running average of last 5 uploads
- Adaptive budgeting: Increases on repeated failures
